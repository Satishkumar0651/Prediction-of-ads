# Prediction-of-ads
The dataset represents a set of possible advertisements on    Internet pages.  The features encode the geometry of the image (if    available) as well as phrases occuring in the URL, the image's URL and    alt text, the anchor text, and words occuring near the anchor text.    The task is to predict whether an image is an advertisement ("ad") or    not ("nonad").
